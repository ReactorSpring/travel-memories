I've configured codespaces so that you don't need to insatlate additional packages or deps.
mvn spring-boot:run launches server backend, npm start launched from ./frontend launches frontend

### How to run  
// You can paste the following commands all at once
mvn spring-boot:run  
cd frontend
npm start


Running properly should display the current time pulled from the backend
