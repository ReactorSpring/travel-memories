# travel-memories

The design of a web application, travel-memories social network, based on react (TypeScript) and spring (Java), the project is carried out in accordance with the principles of Agile and Software Engineering.

## Development info for contributors
When committing something to the repo, remember to add an issue to the project and add it to the project, mark it on the roadmap

I've configured codespaces so that you don't need to insatlate additional packages or deps.
mvn spring-boot:run launches server backend and front, npm start launched from ./frontend launches frontend which will be updated with yours code changes

### How to run  
mvn spring-boot:run
